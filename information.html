          <h2>The First Steps</h2>
          <p>Before you can do anything in making an affective budget that will work,
          you must first get your debt under control. This may seem like obvious
          advice or guidance but it really does not make sense to build an addition
          on your house if it is on fire.

          <h2>Track What You Buy</h2>
          <p>After you get your debt under control the next step is to figure out
            what and how much you are spending a week. This step can be very intimidating
            because every thing you buy or pay for must be tracked. This will show you how
            much you spend a day and where you spend a lot of your money. Doing this activity
            will give you the ability to possibly cut back spending on things that are causing
            you debt.

          <h2>Set Realisitc Goals</h2>
          <p>If you were to just jump into a budget and never had experience with
            a budget you may just give up because of the goals you set were never
            gonna be achieved in the first place. This may sound harsh, but the
            most sucessful budgets start with realistic goals that can actually
            be met. The reason this is so affective is it allows you to meet a
            goal and get the gratification of doing so, which encouages you to
            contiune with your budget.

              This idea has not been fully adopted yet but seems to be a huge sucess with the younger population.
              The idea that you "pay yourself" first might seem weird but this is how it works: When ever you get paid,
              whether that be a paycheck or morning from an outside source, take 10% of that money and move it into a
              different account where it can not be touched easily. Just this little step can help you save so much money
              quickly and is so easy to do, you will immediately see rewards and it feels good seeing that money set aside.

              If you are moving out of your parent's house for the first time and have no idea what you can afford
              for rent or how much you should even spend, the 30% rule gives you a great starting point on how much
              it should be. For even number sakes let's say you make $1,000 a month. Following the 30% rule you would
              do some simple math, 1,000 x 0.3 would be about 300. So that means you should look to spend no more than
              $300 on rent. If you can spend less than the 30% rule you could ideally add that amount to the 10% you
              would pay yourself.

              The second biggest purchase people make aside from mortgage/rental payments are cars. Knowing what you
              can afford upfront will help you make better choices on what kind of car you should get, New, Used, or
              a Lease. Regardless of how you purchase a car you should keep the payment at or under 10%. A lot of
              first time car buyers will spend way to much monthly on the car payment and will struggle to buy gas or
              even pay for insurance. If you purchase a car you should strive to make at least a 20% down payment,
              that might seem like a lot but that will save you money in the long run. You will end up owing less
              so your monthly payments may possibly be cheaper and you will have to pay less for interest depnding
              on your loan agreement.
